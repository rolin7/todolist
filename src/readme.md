I'm readme!!
I have also been learning react native because I want to develop an app for my community that can run on android and ios. 
I have been following a great tutorial on Youtube and I purchased a udemy course that covers React.js. 
So far with my project, I have firebase set up for storage and user authentication. 
I'm currently creating tabs for the different pages I want in the app.
My mom needed to convert the time she worked (minus a 30 minute break) to a decimal to put on her timesheet so I quickly made her this calculator. 
It looks fine on her phone and was mostly made for utility, but I definitely want to make it look great on any size screen and maybe add extra functionality. 
Computing her time for the entire week or calculating her take home pay are good starting points.
